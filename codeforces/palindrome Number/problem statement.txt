Given an integer \(x\), , Print "YES" if \(x\) is a 
palindrome , and \(false\) otherwise.

first line of input contains an integer \(t\) (\0 <= t <= 10^5\), the number of test cases. Then follows \(t\) lines, each containing an integer \(x\)(\1 <= x <= 10^9\).

for each test case, print "YES" if \(x\) is a palindrome, and "NO" otherwise.
