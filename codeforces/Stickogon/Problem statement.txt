    You are given n
 sticks of lengths \(a1,a2,…,an.\)
Find the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously, such that:

Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick.
No stick is used in more than 1
 polygon.
\(Note\): Sticks cannot be broken.


The first line contains a single integer\(Note\) t
 (1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer \(n\) \((1≤n≤100
)\)
  — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains \(n\)
 integers\(a1,a2,…,an\) 
 \((1≤ai≤100)\) — the stick lengths.


For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks available.
